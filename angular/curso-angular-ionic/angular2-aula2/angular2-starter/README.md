# Angular Starter - Munif





To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Based on example of the **Angular 2 From The Ground Up** course by Mirko Nasato.
